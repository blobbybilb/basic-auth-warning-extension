        <h1>URL Basic Auth Warning</h1>

        Displays a warning when you are about to visit a URL that contains basic
        auth credentials, to help prevent possible phishing attacks.
        <br /><br />
        Clicking on a link to a URL like like
        <code>example.com@something.zip</code> would take you to a website with
        the domain something.zip, which may not be what you expect, and may
        allow an attacker to conduct a phishing attack by imitatiing
        example.com. This extension should display a warning when this is
        happening, and may help prevent that. Of course, it is not a guarantee,
        and you are still responsible for your own security.
