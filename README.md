# basic-auth-warning-extension

Displays a warning when you are about to visit a URL that contains basic
auth credentials, to help prevent possible phishing attacks.
<br /><br />
Clicking on a link to a URL like
<code>example.comâˆ•file@something.zip</code> would take you to a website with
the domain something.zip, which may not be what you expect, and may
allow an attacker to conduct a phishing attack by imitatiing
example.com. This extension should display a warning when this is
happening, and may help prevent that. Of course, it is not a guarantee,
and you are still responsible for your own security.
